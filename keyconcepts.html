        <h1>Key Concepts in SEO</h1>
        <h2>PPC</h2>
            <p>PPC stands for pay per click. It is a form of digital advertising where businesses display
            ads on search engine or social media websites and only pay when someone clicks on the ad. When a user searches 
            certain keywords, advertiser's ads will appear at the top of the search engine's results.</p>
        <h2>SEM</h2>
            <p>SEM strands for search engine marketing. It is a type of digital marketing that is a combination of SEO and PPC.
            SEO is organic interactions and PPM is paid for interactions. Search marketing is a blend of the two in order
            to optimize the number of people that see and interact with a website.</p>
        <h2>Crawling</h2>
            <p>Crawling is how a search engine or other company uses a program to search the internet. The program "crawls" a website and gathers it's information. </p>
        <h2>Indexing</h2>
            <p>Indexing is what happens after a website is crawled. The website's data is processed and collected. The data collected is then analyzed and grouped
            together based on similarity. This information is then displayed by the search engine when it recieves a query from the user.</p>

        <h2>Sitemap</h2>
            <p>A sitemap is a file that the website owner creates to provide information about the site's text, images, and videos. It tells the search engine which pages
            and files are most important on a site. It's a way for the search engine to crawl a website more effectively. This file is mainly used for big websites with over 500 pages.</p>
        <h2>Structured Data</h2>
            <p>Structured data is data that has been organized. It's adding additional html tags that the user can't see but a search engine can. It gives the search engine a better understanding
            of what the website is covering and the data is displaying.</p>
