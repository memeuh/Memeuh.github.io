            <h1>What is Search Engine Optimization?</h1>
        <p>
            SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. 
            Search engines such as google are how users find and interact with websites. 
            They are the main way websites are found by users on the internet.
            SEO is about helping search engines be able to find and understand your website. 
            It’s about improving your website’s ability to be found in search. The better visibility
            a website's pages have in search, the more likely users are going to find and visit a site.
