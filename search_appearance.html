            <p>How a website is displayed on a search engine depends on a variety of factors.</p>
        <h2>Structured Data</h2>
            <p>Structured data is what Google or another search engine uses in order to serve it's users search results.
            It's what happens after the data is aquired through crawling and then stored through indexing. The data is then
            processed and analyzed into structured data. The search engine then uses that data to serve the user websites based
            on their query.</p>
        <h2>Relevancy</h2>
            <p>When a client enters in a query into a search engine, the engine will search it's index for the most relevant pages.
            Relevancy is determined by different factors such a the client's location, language, device along with the query. Similairly
            worded queries won't produce the same results. For example searching "mexican restaurant near me" will produce different results
            than "authentic mexican food". </p>
        <h2>Ranking</h2>
            <p>The search engine will rank a website based on a number of different factors. These factors include relevance, quality of content,
                and usability. </p>
            <p>Using certain keywords that are relevant to your site's content will improve it's rankings in search results. 
            It's important to put these keywords in headings and body paragraphs in order for the search engine to easily find your site.</p>
            <p>The quality of a website's content is also an integral part of whether it will show up in search results. Google determines the quality of a site based on
                the content's expertise and authoritativeness. One of the ways they determine this is if other prominent websites link or refer to the content. This is a sign that
                a site's content is trustworthy, since it's been verified by others. Sites with original content are also prioritized.</p>
            <p>The usability of a website website also determines how it shows up in search results. Websites that are mobile friendly and load quickly are prioritized.
                If your site is less usable for mobile users, it's less likely to show up in search results. </p>
