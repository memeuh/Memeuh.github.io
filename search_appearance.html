        <h1>Search Appearance</h1>
            <p>How a website is displayed on a search engine depends on a variety of factors.</p>
        <h2>Structured Data</h2>
            <p>Structured data is what Google or another search engine uses in order to serve it's users search results.
            It's what happens after the data is aquired through crawling and then stored through indexing. The data is then
            processed and analyzed into structured data. The search engine then uses that data to serve the user websites based
            on their query.</p>
        <h2>Relevancy</h2>
            <p>When a client enters in a query into a search engine, the engine will search it's index for the most relevant pages.
            Relevancy is determined by different factors such a the client's location, language, device along with the query. Similairly
            worded queries won't produce the same results. For example searching "mexican restaurant near me" will produce different results
            than "authentic mexican food". </p>
        <h2>Ranking</h2>
            <p>The search engine will rank a website based on a number of different factors</p>
