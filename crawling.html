        <h1>Crawling</h1>
            <p>Crawling is when Google or another search engine uses automated programs 
                called crawlers to download text, images, and videos from different websites. </p>
        <h1>Indexing</h1>
            <p>
            Indexing is when Google analyzes the data the crawler programs found
                and then stores all that data in an database.
            </p>
            <h2>How to make your website more visible to crawlers</h2>
                <p>There's multiple ways to make your website more visible to Google's crawler programs. The more easily Google can find your site, the 
            more often it's going to display your website in search results. </p>
            <h3>Using a Sitemap</h3>
                <p>A sitemap is a file that you provide to Google or another search engine with information about a website's videos, images, and text. It's generally only needed
                for large websites or websites that are mainly video and images since those are harder for crawlers to parse the data.</p>
            <h3>URL Structure</h3>
            <p>Using a crawlable URL structure is essential to search engine optimization. Following Google's guidelines such as having a simple, descriptive URL will make your
            website more visible. It also helps with marketing. Another way URL structure impacts SEO is the use of hypens to seperate words. Crawlers better understand URLs with hypens (-)
            than URLs with all the words smashed together.</p>

            <h2>Mobile First Indexing</h2>
            <p>Most people using the internet today are using it on a mobile device. Google has a seperate program that indexes and ranks website's based on their mobile experience.
            This approach is called Mobile First Indexing. Making sure your content is eas</p>
